GENERAL
* Why is App.js rendering twice on startup?
* Research UUID - I have a feeling the way I'm handling keys and ids is amateur
* Use debugger to figure out the flow upon finding a match

CURRENTLY SELECTED HIGHLIGHT LOGIC
* Select a tile via click
If first click
* set currentClick to selected tile. lastClick remains null.
* To determine if second click, check for truthy value of currentClick
If second click
* set lastClick to value of currentClick
* set currentClick to selected tile
* check for equality
* if no, present 'no match' modal in currentClick's tile (can just console.log for now)
* Reset currentClick and lastClick to null
* if yes, remove layer (can just set backgroundColor to an empty string in current example)
* incremement current combo
* set lastClick to null
* set currentClick to selected tile




or upon succesful match with no remaining layers in currently selected square:

const currentClick
const lastClick
